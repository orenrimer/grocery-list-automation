"# grocery-list-automation" 

Building a simple python automation script, that reads a grocery list CSV entered by the user, then using Selenium Webdriver goes into the 'Walmart.com' website and adds all of the items on the list(including quantity and max price if entered) to the user's cart. 
After all the items were added the program will send an email notifying the user that the order was placed successfully (including a screenshot of the user cart).
